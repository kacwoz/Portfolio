# Portfolio
Hello,
My name is Kacper Wozniak. I  finished my first degree studies in materials engineering and I'm currently writing my master's thesis on Chemical Technology.
My passion was always computers, but in my secondary school computer science was at a poor level of learning as a result of I went to mathematics, physics and chemicals class. I was really good in chemistry and it was reason why I went to chemistry study. 

In each of my jobs, the most fascinating thing for me was working with data and what you can mining from them. For this reason, I decided to start my change of industry.

Below I present dashboards which I made.
